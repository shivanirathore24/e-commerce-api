## REST API

## Understanding API
### Problems with MVC
1. Complexity: MVC can become complex as the application grows, making it
difficult to maintain and understand the code.
2. Tight coupling: Components in MVC can be tightly coupled, making it
challenging to modify one component without affecting others.
3. Difficulty in making changes: Due to the complex and tightly coupled nature
of MVC, making changes to the application can be difficult.
4. Difficulty in scaling: As the application grows, scaling an MVC architecture
can pose challenges.

### API (Application Programming Interface)
APIs are different from MVC in terms of how they handle data. In MVC, the server
typically renders views and sends them to the client, which includes both the
structure and data to be displayed. On the other hand, APIs primarily focus on
sending data instead of views.
- APIs provide a solution to the problems of tightly-coupled systems in MVC
applications.
- APIs separate the frontend and backend components, allowing them to
communicate through a well-defined interface.
- APIs enable easier modification of individual components without impacting
the entire system.
- APIs promote code reusability and facilitate the use of existing services and
data from other applications

### Types of APIs
SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol): A protocol for exchanging structured
information in web services. It uses XML and relies on transport protocols like
HTTP or SMTP.
- REST (Representational State Transfer): An architectural style for designing
networked applications. It uses HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
to perform operations on resources identified by URIs. RESTful APIs are easy
to build, maintain, and scale.
- GraphQL: A query language and runtime for APIs. It allows clients to request
only the data they need, making it more efficient than traditional REST APIs.
GraphQL can also aggregate data from multiple source

## Understanding REST
### RESTful API
- Representational State Transfer is an architectural style for designing
networked applications that use standard HTTP protocols to communicate
between the client and server. REST APIs are built on top of the HTTP
protocol and work with resources identified by URLs.
- Stateless architecture is a key principle of REST, meaning the server doesn't
store client-specific states between requests. Each request must contain all
the necessary information for the server to process it. The advantages of a
stateless architecture include improved scalability, easier maintenance, and
better fault tolerance.
- It is an Architectural Guideline
- It is popularly used across different types of systems.
### Benefits REST API
The benefits of using REST APIs include simplicity, scalability, cacheability,
interoperability, flexibility, and security

### REST Methods
REST APIs use standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to
perform operations on resources.
1. GET requests to retrieve information about a resource or a collection of
resources.
2. POST requests create a new resource.
3. PUT requests to update an existing resource.
4. DELETE requests remove a resource.

### Applications of REST
REST APIs play a crucial role in modern web applications, allowing them to
efficiently communicate and exchange data with various systems. Some common
applications of REST APIs include:

1. **Integrating with third-party services:** REST APIs can be used to interact
with external services like social media platforms, payment gateways, or
analytics tools, adding more functionality to your web application.
2. **Creating a consistent backend for multiple platforms:** REST APIs can
serve as a common backend for web, mobile, and desktop applications,
ensuring that all platforms access the same data and logic.
3. **Developing microservices:** REST APIs can be used to break down a
monolithic application into smaller, more manageable microservices,
improving scalability and maintainability.

## Getting Started with API Project
<img src="./images/e-commerce_api.png" alt="Applications of REST API" width="650" height="auto">


## Project Set-Up
### 1. Initialize Node.js Project
```bash
npm init
```
This creates `package.json` for managing dependencies.

### 2. Install Express.js
Express.js is required to set up a web server. Install it using:

```bash
npm install express.
```

### 3. Steps to create the folder structure
1. Create a new folder named "E-Commerce API" for the project.
2. Inside the "E-COMMERCE API" folder, add a file named "server.js" to serve as the
main server file for the project.
```javascript
// 1. Import Server
import express from "express";

// 2. Create Server
const server = express();

// 3. Default Request Handler
server.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Welcome to E-commerce API");
});

// 4. Speicify port
const PORT = 3000;
server.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${PORT}`);
});
```

3. Create a new folder named "src" inside the "E-COMMERCE API" folder to store the
source code of the application.
4. Inside the "src" folder, create a folder named “features”
5. Inside the "features" folder, create separate folders for different modules of
the application such as "cart", "order", "product", and "user". These folders
will contain the respective module-related files.
6. Additionally, create a folder named "middlewares" inside the "src" folder to
store middleware files that will be used in the application.

### 4. Configure .gitignore

Create a `.gitignore file` and add `node_modules/` to exclude unnecessary files from Git tracking, keeping your repository clean.

### 5. Run Server

#### Way-1: Run the server manually:

```bash
node index.js
```

#### Way-2: Automatically restart server on changes:

Install nodemon globally:

```bash
npm install -g nodemon
```

- Installs nodemon system-wide.
- Not tied to any specific project.
- Doesn't appear in package.json.
- You can run nodemon from anywhere in the terminal.

OR

Install nodemon locally (--save-dev flag):

```bash
npm i -D nodemon (or npm install --save-dev nodemon)
```

- Installs nodemon only for the current project.
- Gets added under devDependencies in package.json; as only needed during development, not in production.
- To run it, you must use npx nodemon or configure it in package.json.

Update package.json → Add this inside the "scripts" section:

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "nodemon index.js"
}
```

Run the server with:

```bash
npm start
```

## Setting Up Routes For Product
1. The goal is to create APIs related to products in the E-COMMERCE API project.
2. The APIs to be created for the product module are:
    - Get all products
    - Add a product
    - Get one product
    - Rate a product
    - Filter Product
3. These APIs will be handled in the product controller.
4. A separate folder for controllers can be created within the product module to
manage multiple controllers.
5. The product controller file is created as "product.controller.js" in the product
folder.
6. The product routes file is created as "product.routes.js" in the product folder.
7. Express router module is used to handle paths from the server to controller
methods.
8. The product roots file manages the paths to the product controller.
9. The path "/api/products" is used as a good practice for API paths.
10. The server file redirects requests related to products to the product roots file.
11. The product roots file specifies the paths and calls the respective controller
methods.
12. Other routes for different modules like user and order can be implemented
similarly.
13. Separate route files are recommended for each feature to maintain a modular
structure.

### Code for product.controller.js file:
```javascript
export default class ProductController {
  getAllProducts(req, res) {
    // Code for getting all products
  }

  addProduct(req, res) {
    // Code for adding a product
  }

  rateProduct(req, res) {
    // Code for rating a product
  }

  getOneProduct(req, res) {
    // Code for getting one product
  }
}
```

### Code for product.routes.js:
```javascript
import express from 'express';
import ProductController from './product.controller.js';

const productRouter = express.Router();
const productController = new ProductController();

productRouter.get('/', productController.getAllProducts);
productRouter.post('/', productController.addProduct);
productRouter.get('/:id', productController.getOneProduct);
productRouter.post('/rate', productController.rateProduct);

export default productRouter;
```

### Code for server.js
```javascript
// Import Server
import express from "express";
import productRouter from "./src/features/product/product.routes.js";

// Create Server
const server = express();

//For all request related to products, redirect to product routes.
//localhost:3000/api/products
server.use("/api/products", productRouter);

// Default Request Handler
server.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Welcome to E-commerce API");
});

// Speicify port
const PORT = 3000;
server.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${PORT}`);
});
```
